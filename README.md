The syringe is pushed and pulled by the motor to suck up the colored water on the ground and inject it onto the canvas.

The automated perfusion system paints the canvas, echoing the function of a life support machine.
It explores themes of the augmented body, finitude, and the automation of the artist’s gesture,
while - with a ton of humor - referencing the so-called 'death of painting'.

In the `main.py` file, you’ll find the code that drives the motor's steps.
It calls the two other files that are part of the physical computing course at La Villa Arson.

The hardest part of the project is actually fixing the threaded rod perfectly onto the wood.
It’s very difficult to center it so the syringe is pushed correctly.
That's the reason why the number of steps is only 10 while the real number of steps to actionate completely the syringe is 22. 

Still in progress, this project invites further exploration — with other fabrics, alternative methods for the syringes to paint,
and a deeper focus on its underlying commentary on production and automation.
